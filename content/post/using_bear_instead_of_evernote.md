I tried to get on the Evernote train.

I really did. I installed it god-knows-how-many times, and would put stuff in it and pay my (then much lower) annual fee and put a bunch of crap in it and then, sooner or later, pitter out and not bother with it and not be able to find stuff in it and give up.

I understand that it works really well for some people — I know a few of them. I admire them. I'm not one of them.

But I’m …. well, let’s be honest. I can be _sloppy_.  Evernote seems to require a little more organization than I’m generally capable of — more of an investment than I could bring myself to make.

And….let’s be even _more_ honest. I don’t like the Evernote interface. I want to use Markdown. And tags. And suck my data back out so I don’t get locked in.

There are a zillion ways to keep notes and bookmarks and such, but on those few occasions when I _did_ get into Evernote, the thing I really appreciated was the web clipper. 

The bury-the-lede upshot is that I’m now using [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/). It has a more-than-good-enough-for-me web clipper, really pretty markdown support, a nice iOS application,  and is $15/year at the moment. It also exports your markdown to pdf, html, rtf, docx, and (for some reason) jpg. 

It looks like this (with the solarize theme):

I like the way it shows the markdown while still rendering it in the document.


Bear is a relatively new product and still a work in progress, but I love it, and have started putting everything into it. I’m assuming my use will wax and wane, but for now, I’m happy with it as a way to semi-organize my life, and semi-organized is what I’m going for.
