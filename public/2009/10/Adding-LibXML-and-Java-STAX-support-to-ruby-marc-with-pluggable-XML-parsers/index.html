<p>JRuby is my ruby platform of choice, mostly because I think its deployment options in my work environment are simpler (perhaps technically and certainly politically), but also because I have high, high hopes to use lots of super-optimized native java libraries. The <a href="http://cpan.perl.org/">CPAN</a> is what keeps me tethered to Perl, and whether or not you like Java-the-language, boy, are there a lot of high-quality libraries out there.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ve been messing around with MARC-XML parsing of late, and since Ross Singer added <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/blacklight-development/browse_thread/thread/b6f7e064c0cf0bbd/9cd076ca7eeb1293?hl=en&amp;amp;lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=a+few+rubymarc+announcements#9cd076ca7eeb1293">pluggable xml-parser awesomeness</a> to the ruby-marc project, I thought I&rsquo;d see what I could do with native Java methods when parsing MARC-XML.</p>

<p>And just for kicks, I threw in the old code that I wrote before that uses LibXML.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-this-at-all">Why do this at all?</h3>

<p>Because&hellip;er&hellip;there&rsquo;s an obvious work-situation where I need to squeeze every last drop of speed out of&hellip;ruby&hellip;which we don&rsquo;t use&hellip;er&hellip;</p>

<p>Because. Because I wanted to screw around with the technologies. Because I wanted to learn about calling java native stuff. Because I already wrote the libxml stuff. Because it feels silly to run on the JVM and not use JVM-native code to deal with XML, given that standard java projects make it seem like Java is a giant XML processor with a language wrapped around it.</p>

<h3 id="what-exactly-did-i-do">What exactly did I do?</h3>

<p>For the <a href="http://libxml.rubyforge.org/">LibXML</a> stuff, I copied my own code. For the java <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StAX">stax</a> (javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory.StreamReader) parser, I stole just about everything from Ross&rsquo;s nokogiri code and put it into its own module, and then slimmed down the nokogiri module and the stax module to only include their differences.</p>

<p><a href="http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=27253&amp;group_id=964&amp;atid=3783">The patch</a> is at the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/marc/">ruby-marc rubyforge site</a> if you want to play along at home.</p>

<p>Other than using the stax or libxml parser, everything else is the same &ndash; MARC::Record objects and their components are created exactly as they are with the other parsers. It might be &ldquo;fun&rdquo; (for some twisted definition of &ldquo;fun&rdquo;) to wrap the MARC::Record interface around <a href="http://marc4j.tigris.org/">marc4j</a> at some point, but right now all that&rsquo;s changed is the parsing.</p>

<h3 id="do-they-work">Do they work?</h3>

<p>Yes. Thanks for asking. At least all the tests pass when I type &lsquo;rake&rsquo;.</p>

<h3 id="how-fast-is-it">How fast is it?</h3>

<p>As always, the numbers are iffy. These were done on my desktop, with other stuff going on. I didn&rsquo;t bother to benchmark <code>rexml</code> because we know how slow <em>that</em> is.</p>

<p>The test file is a nightly dump intended to go into our VuFind install. It was born as binary marc, and changed to marc-xml using <code>yaz-marcdump</code>, which is so fast that I thought maybe something had gone wrong. Holy cow, is <code>yaz-marcdump</code> fast.</p>

<p>The resulting XML is 219MB and contains 46,242 records.</p>

<p>The test was to open it up, loop through the records, and pull the 245 out of each. Each segment looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">
  reader = MARC::XMLReader.new(filename, :parser=&gt;'jstax')
  reader.each do |record|
    title = record[245]
  end

</code></pre>

<p>Times are in seconds. I ran each one five times, with the exception of <code>jrexml</code>, during which I got bored.  And the perl code, for which I just wanted to get a ballpark to compare.</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>MRI 1.8.7
    libxml     104    (103, 103, 106, 104, 103)
    nokogiri   301    (304, 300, 301, 301, 300)</p>

<p>JRuby trunk
    jrexml     547    (539, 554)
    jstax      203    (201, 208, 201, 201, 204 )</p>

<p>Perl 5.10 w/MARC::File:XML
    perl       340    (340)</p>

<p>~~~~</p>

<h4 id="so-faster-right">So&hellip;faster, right?</h4>

<p>Pretty much, yeah.</p>

<p>Under (MRI) ruby, Ross found that nokogiri was 3.5x faster than rexml, and my noodling-around at home showed the same speedup. Using that as a baseline, we get the following speed comparison table using the libxml time normalized to 1.00.</p>

<p>In case that wasn&rsquo;t clear: lower numbers are better.</p>

<pre><code>libxml:   1.00
jstax:    1.95
nokogiri: 2.89
jrexml:   5.16
rexml:    10.11 (estimated; 3.5x nokogiri's speed)
</code></pre>

<h3 id="what-does-it-all-mean">What does it all mean?</h3>

<p>It means that adding pluggable parsers was freakin&rsquo; brilliant.</p>

<p>It means that a guy like me &ndash; with no real expertise in <em>any</em> of the applicable technologies &ndash; can do a passable job at integrating a java library into JRuby.</p>

<p>And it means that if I (a) can get folks around here to use Ruby, and (b) can get them to use MARC-XML instead of binary MARC (which we can&rsquo;t use anyway because of the record-length limitations), I can be sure that any bottlenecks aren&rsquo;t going to be the result of those choices.</p>
