	<article>
		<p>Not long after I started working in the library, I heard someone talking about &ldquo;Evidence Based Librarianship.&rdquo; Like the good little kind-of-a-librarian I&rsquo;d become, I looked it up and found <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=35250">this article</a> which states that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>EBL employs the best available evidence based upon library science research to arrive at sound decisions about solving practical problems in librarianship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My immediate response was, of course, <em>What the $#!&amp;% is everyone else doing?</em></p>

<p>The sad truth, of course,  is that in general folks working in libraries do <em>not</em> use the &ldquo;best evidence&rdquo; based on &ldquo;library science research&rdquo; because, like many of the practitioners I met when I was in the education world, they (a) don&rsquo;t know most of the research and data, and (b) are convinced that their users are so magical, so special, so utterly <em>unique</em>, that there&rsquo;s no point in looking to the research and are better off just going with their guts.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an over-simplification, of course. But I have found, across a bunch of situations, that practicing librarians tend to think:</p>

<ol>
<li>their time is much better spent directly helping patrons than reading about research regarding how to help patrons,</li>
<li>&ldquo;data&rdquo; (defined incredibly loosely) derived from reference desk interviews are sufficient to make decisions</li>
<li>&ldquo;I know my patrons better than anyone&rdquo;</li>
</ol>

<p>The logical conclusions to this is that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Most library research is essentially being thrown down a dark hole because the people that could most benefit from it don&rsquo;t read it</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re assuming that the 99.999% of users who never talk to a librarian (many of whom, in fact, never enter the library building) have the exact same needs and perspective as those who engage in reference interviews</li>
<li>Librarians, as a group, confuse casual and/or episodic interaction with self-selected patrons with actual social-science research.</li>
</ol>

<p>And the over-simplified solutions:</p>

<p><strong>Make reading a job requirement &ndash; for real!</strong> Make librarians responsible for keeping up with the literature &ndash; &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; in a &ldquo;prove to your direct manager that you spent two hours reading and writing this week&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Librarians as a group, I think, <em>want</em> to use the research. But not so much that they&rsquo;re willing to let Curmudgeonly Old Faculty Member #2 hang tight for a few hours while they brush up.</p>

<p><strong>Use the data you already have!</strong> Your systems &ndash; your ILS, any reference desk software, your proxy server, your web server &ndash; all collect data. Warehouse the data. Mine the data. Provide both colorful graphical interfaces and ugly powerful analysis functions for the data. <strong>Figure out how to do something with the freakin&rsquo; data!</strong></p>

<p>Most (all?) libraries have <em>gobs</em> of data that are pulled out once a year for ACRL statistics. And even if they&rsquo;re looked at by someone, they&rsquo;re certainly not easily available to <em>everyone</em>.</p>

<p>Push access to the data and associated visualization tools as far down the stack as you can. At least people will know what kinds of questions can be answered.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t pretend to do research &ndash; <em>do</em> real research!</strong> Do real social science research &ndash; something that certainly doesn&rsquo;t have a front-seat in library schools as near as I can tell. Find some MS students in Sociology or Anthropology who are looking for a project and ask them to find something out, with real honest-to-god case study methodology, text analysis, data analysis &ndash; the whole nine yards. Better yet &ndash; hire someone to do it, and for <em>god&rsquo;s sake</em> don&rsquo;t put down that they must have an MLS.</p>

<p>Times are tight all around, of course &ndash; no one has enough time, enough money, enough resources. But that&rsquo;s exactly why <em>now</em> is the time to focus on existing research (it&rsquo;s free &ndash; someone already did it) and data (it&rsquo;s free &ndash; your systems are already collecting it) &ndash; to find out what&rsquo;s being used, what&rsquo;s being ignored, how to market your under-utilized resources and which populations need some outreach.</p>

<p>Going with your gut might seem to work, but maybe that&rsquo;s only because you&rsquo;re not actually using any solid criteria to evaluate what you&rsquo;re doing now.</p>
