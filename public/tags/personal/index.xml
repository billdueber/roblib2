      <description>The baby spent all last week in the hospital. Nothing life-threatening (so long as he was in the hospital and could get O2 when needed); it was just annoying.
So&amp;hellip;.here&amp;rsquo;s to a week-long hospital stay being able to be merely &amp;ldquo;annoying&amp;rdquo;. A tip of the hat to steady employment, generous sick/vacation policies, flexible co-workers, excellent insurance, and having a world-class hospital in town. This could have been a much, much worse week than it was.</description>

      <description>We had another baby. :-)

Shai Brown Dueber was born last Monday, the 3rd, at a very moderate 7lbs 7.2oz (his brothers were 9lbs and 9.5lbs). Mother, baby, and older brothers are all doing well. Father is freakin&amp;rsquo; tired.
